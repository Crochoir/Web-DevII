        <h3>Music and Arts</h3>

          <p>Since i was very young, I have had music all around me. My father plays guitar, and my mother loves to sing.
            I have been playing music since i was fourteen, picking up a guitar and enduring the two weeks of building calluses.
            Now, however, I could not imagine a world where i didn't have a guitar at my side to strum a few chords and sing a few songs.
            My talents in music don't end with vocals and an acoustic guitar, I also like to rock out on an electric or bass guitar, and i play the drums.</p>

        <h3>Website and Software Development</h3>

          <p class= "clear-example">Software and Web development is a newer insight into my creative output.
            I started software development in the C-sharp language, building common ToDo apps and even a few mini games, like a classic snake game or a space invaders game.
            I guess you could say that developing proficiency in web development is my newest project. I have already learned so much working in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            I'm excited to work on more projects, furthering my knowledge and abilities into potential job opportunities. But most importantly, just to have fun learning and creating, like I always have.</p>
